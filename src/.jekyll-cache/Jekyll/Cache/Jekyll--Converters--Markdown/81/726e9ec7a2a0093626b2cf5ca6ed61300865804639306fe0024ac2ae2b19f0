I"1<p>One of the major challenges of working with AWS is working with IAM. Everything is built around IAM and having permission to do whatever technical action. As an engineer the experience of knowing that I need a set of permissions for my role to utilize to do an action like reading from DynamoDB has made my job much easier. For example in a typical cloudformation policy something like aws::table would be sufficient to read objects from that table, but if i wanted to read from the index of said table I would have to modify the permission respectively</p>
