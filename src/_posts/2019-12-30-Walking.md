I have started to walk around my local park (There aren't many of those in Los Angeles). As someone who does not particularly enjoy cardio it is surprising to me how much I enjoy walking around greenspace. I just walk around listening to music or podcasts. This was one of my favorite activities when visting New York City especially around Central Park.
