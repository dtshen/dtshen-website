So a week has passed since Kobe Bryant has died. The first couple hours after hearing the news was complete shock. I couldn't actually feel anything at all. But after 4 hours I just broke down especially after learning the death of Gianna. As a southern California kid growing up I always rooted for the lakers, but was never a massive Kobe fan. However as I got older and especially after Kobe retired I gained more and more respect for the man. His dedication, work ethic and sheer determination were all attributes that I really admired. I didn't realize how much I respected him until he was gone. Kobe can't die. He is Batman. We are all here to hold onto that mantle and keep working hard and thats how we will honor him. RIP Kobe. Mamba out.
