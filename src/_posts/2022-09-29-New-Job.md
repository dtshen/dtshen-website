I have been working at Microsoft for a little less than 3 months. I have joined the PowerBI team and am working on the Excel Integration team. So far things have been good with my teammates and the work in general. There is a lot to learn and I feel that it will be a while before I am fully proficient. I am attempting to improve out documentation and general asynchronous communication models. I have been reading/writing in C# mostly and learning the internal tooling. A lot of low hanging fruit seems to be solved already.
